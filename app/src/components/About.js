            <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Tyler, a passionate computer scientist with a love for making cool and functional software.</p>
            <p>With a few years of coding experience in several languages, I specialize in Java, but I am branching out to other JVM based languages like Java, Kotlin, and Scala. I also am teaching myself how to use popular front-end frameworks like React and Angular.</p>
            <p>Most of my projects are fun or interesting, but nothing too serious. Serious projects are in the works!</p>
            <p>Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities. I'm always excited to work on new and exciting projects!</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
